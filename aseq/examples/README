Here we provide a data test set. 
We assume `example' to be current directory and ASEQ executable to be in the current directory (in Windows substitute `/' with `\').

PILEUP
======

To run the pileup for a single VCF and a single BAM file use the following command:

./ASEQ vcf=./VCF_samples/sample1.vcf bam=./BAM_samples/sample1.bam threads=1 mbq=20 mrq=1 mdc=5 out=./Results

To run multiple pileups use the following command:

./ASEQ vcflist=vcf.list bamlist=bam.list threads=1 mbq=20 mrq=1 mdc=5 out=./Results

Note that we always require one VCF per BAM; hence each position entry in the vcf.list corresponds to the corrresponding position entry in the bam.list.
Files *.PILEUP.ASEQ will be generated, each containing the read counts for the input SNPs from the VCF file(s).

GENOTYPE
========

To run genotype calls for a single VCF and a single BAM file use the following command:

./ASEQ vcf=./VCF_samples/sample1.vcf bam=./BAM_samples/sample1.bam mode=GENOTYPE threads=1 mbq=20 mrq=1 mdc=5 htperc=0.2 out=./Results

To run genotype calls for multiple files use the following command:

./ASEQ vcf=./VCF_samples/sample1.vcf bamlist=bam.list mode=GENOTYPE threads=1 mbq=20 mrq=1 mdc=5 htperc=0.2 out=./Results

Files *.GENOTYPE.ASEQ will be generated, each containing the read counts for the input SNPs from the VCF file(s).
Files *.heterozygous.vcf will be generated, each containing the heterozygous SNPs.
Files *.genotype.vcf will be generated, each containing the SNPs genotype calls.

More information about output files format can be found in the ASEQ Manual.

ASE
===

Tu run an ASE analysis use the following command:

./ASEQ vcflist=vcf.list bamlist=bam.list genes=genes.bed mode=ASE threads=1 mbq=20 mrq=1 pht=0.01 pft=0.01 out=./Results

or 

./ASEQ vcflist=vcf.list bamlist=bam.list transcripts=transcripts.interval mode=ASE threads=1 mbq=20 mrq=1 pht=0.01 pft=0.01 out=./Results


Files *.ASE.ASEQ will be generated, containing read counts for the input SNPs.
In addition the following files will be created:

- ASE_genes.csv = List of genes showing ASE with ASE calculation results and number of samples available for ASE calculation; 
- genes_statistics.csv = Detailed view of ASE calculation with ASE value of all the samples for all the ASE genes;
- snps_per_gene.csv = Table containing the number of hitting SNPs for all genes in all the samples.

More information about output files format can be found in the ASEQ Manual.


ASE pipeline
============

the typical ASEQ pipeline for ASE analysis is executed by performing sequentially the following steps:

1) Create list dnaseq.list with DNAseq BAM files paths for all the samples and download ASEQ-annotation-files.tar.gz to get the list of dbsnp137 SNPs that overlapp UCSC KnownGene hg19 genes;

2) Run command "./ASEQ vcf=dbsnp.137.UCSC.Coding.chrRecoded.vcf bamlist=dnaseq.list mode=GENOTYPE threads=6 mbq=20 mrq=20 mdc=10 htperc=0.2 out=./Genotype" with favorite parameters;

3) Create vcf.list with *.heterozygous.vcf files generated in ./genotype in step 2 and create list rnaseq.list with the corresponding RNAseq BAM files paths for all the samples. 
Download ASEQ-annotation-files.tar.gz to get gene and transcript input models built using UCSC hg19 KnownGenes files; 

4) Run command "./ASEQ vcflist=vcf.list bamlist=rnaseq.list genes=genes.bed mode=ASE threads=6 mbq=20 mrq=20 mdc=10 pht=0.01 pft=0.01 out=./ASE_analysis" with genes.bed or transcripts.interval files.
